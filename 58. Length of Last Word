class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        while(s.size()>0&&s.back()==' ')        //we delete trailing spaces
        s.pop_back();

        int ans=0;
        while(s.size()>0&&s.back()!=' ')        //we count no.of characters of last word
        {s.pop_back();ans++;}

        return ans;
    }
};
