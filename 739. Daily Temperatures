739. Daily Temperatures

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

 

Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100*/

        ans.back()=0;

        //we loop from back to front of the temperature vector.if a smaller temperature is encountered on top of stack,we remove that as that wont be needed.this we do that until we encounter a higher
        //temperature on top of stack than current temperature or stack becomes empty.

        //if stack is empty,it means no higher temperature in future than current temp.so we put 0 in that index of ans vector
        //if stack is not empty,it mean there exists a higher temperature at a particular index than current temperature.so we subtract both indexes and place result at corresponding index of ans vector
